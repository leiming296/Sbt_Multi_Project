  Hyphens
  
  ***
  
  Asterisks
  
  ___
  
  Underscores
  
  
 ###  Blockquotes
  
  
  > Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
  > This line is part of the same quote.
  
  Quote break.
  
  > This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 
  
  
  ### Table Summary  
  
  Colons can be used to align columns.
  
  | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
  | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
  | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
  | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
  | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
  
  There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
  The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
  raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
  
  Markdown | Less | Pretty
  --- | --- | ---
  *Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
  1 | 2 | 3
